# Tutorial & Practise

The first lab of the course was about understanding the basics about Octave.

Also, 6 simple exercises for practise were given to us, with their solutions on the presentation.

In this folder I give my solutions for those exercises, with most of them to differ from the given.

#### Exercise 1

Initialize an array of dimension 100x100, with random numbers uniformly distributed in interval [0,1].

a) Display the numbers between 45 and 49 row and 34 and 37 column.

b) Calculate how many numbers in the array are greater than 0.5.

c) Calculate sum of arrays's elements.

d) Calculate the mean of array's elements.

#### Exercise 2

Solve the linear system:

2x + 7y + 3z = 5 <br/>
4x - 5y - z = 10 <br/>
2x - 4y + z = -1

#### Exercise 3

Define a function that takes two arrays A,B as arguments and return the sum Σij A(i,j)\*B(i,j).

#### Exercise 4

Plot in same figure the Standard Normal Distribution and Normal Distribution with mu = 0 and sigma^2 = 2.

#### Exercise 5

Plot in the same Octave Window, but different graphs the functions:

- f(x) = sin(x)
- f(x) = cos(x)
- f(x) = sin(2*x)
- f(x) = cos(2*x)

for the interval [-π, π].

#### Exercise 6

Define function powers, which takes a number and returns it's square, cube, quad and cinq power.

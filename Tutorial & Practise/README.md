# Tutorial & Practise

The first lab of the course was about understanding the basics about Octave.

Also, 6 simple exercises for practise were given to us, with their solutions on the presentation. I solve those problems, some of them a little bit different than the proposed solution.

#### Exercise 1

Initialize an array of dimension 100x100, with random numbers uniformly distributed in interval [0,1].

a) Display the numbers between 45 and 49 row and 34 and 37 column.

b) Calculate how many numbers in the array are greater than 0.5.

c) Calculate sum of arrays's elements.

d) Calculate the mean of array's elements.

#### Exercise 2

Solve the linear system:

2x + 7y + 3z = 5
4x - 5y - z = 10
2x - 4y + z = -1

#### Exercise 3

Define a function that takes two arrays A,B as arguments and return the

# QueueingSystems-NTUA-2021

This repo holds the assignements and the code of the 5 labs of Queueing Systems, NTUA course for summer semester of academic year 2020-2021.

All the assignements and reports are written in Greek, because that is the main language of this course. 

Each folder consists of the assignement, the report and the code of each lab. Furthermore, I included a README file, trying to describe the tasks of each lab in English.

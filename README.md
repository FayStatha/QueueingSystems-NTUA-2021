# QueueingSystems-NTUA-2021

This repository contains the assignments, code and reports of the 5 lab exercises for ECE/NTUA course "Queueing Systems" in academic year 2019-2020.

There is a folder for each lab, and each one has a README file with a simple description of the tasks in English.

All the assignements and reports are written in Greek, because that is the main language of this course.

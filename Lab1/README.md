# Tutorial & Practise

The first lab of the course was about understanding Poisson Distribution, Exponential Distribution and Poisson Counting Process.

The code for the first exercise was given to us, as a demo code, and we only made some small changes.

#### Exercise 1

##### Task A

Plot the Probability Mass Function of Poisson Distribution with lambda = [10, 30, 50], in interval [0,70]. 

#### Task B

For Poisson Distribution with lambda = 30, calculate the Mean Value and Variance.

#### Task C

Calculate and plot the convolution of Poisson Distributions with lambda = 10 and lambda = 50.

#### Task D

Show that Poisson Distribution is a limit for Binomial Distribution, when n->inf. 

Plot the equivalent Poisson Distribution of Binomial Distribution with n = [300, 3000, 30000].

#### Exercise 2

##### Task A

Plot the Probability Density Function of Exponential Distribution with mean = [0.5, 1, 3], in interval [0,8]. 

#### Task B

Plot the Cumulative Distribution Function of Exponential Distribution with mean = [0.5, 1, 3], in interval [0,8]. 

#### Task C

For Exponential Distribution with mean = 2.5 calculate P(X>30000) and P(X>50000 | X>20000).

Where 30000, 50000 and 20000 is the position in xaxis vector.

#### Exercise 3

##### Task A

Generate 100 random exponential events and plot the Poisson Counting Process for them. Use lambda = 5.

#### Task B

Calculate the mean of the numbers of events in the unit of time. Use 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 10000 events.

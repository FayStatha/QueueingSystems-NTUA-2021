# Lab 4

The fourth lab of the course was about understanding M/M/c/c queues and M/M/2 queues with different probabilities to each server.

This lab was mainly theoretical and most of the tasks was about calculating things on hand.

The code for the second exercise, which is a simulation of an M/M/2 queue with different probabilities to each server, was given to us. 

We only needed to change the thresholds, so that each random number used for the simulation could lead us to the right transition.
